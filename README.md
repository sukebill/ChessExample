# ChessExample
A small project regarding the possible paths of a Knight (chess piece) in 3 movements.

The App renders a chessboard (N * N) with the user being able to decide the size of the board.

With the first tap the user selects a tile, the starting position of the Knight (chess piece), and with a second tap the user selects the destination tile. 
The App calculates all possible paths - routes the piece can take, in 3 chess movements, reaching the destination tile.
If no possible path - route exists in those 3 chess movements, no route is shown.
